# Machine Learning, Deep Learning & GenAI Project Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a curated portfolio of hands-on projects covering
classical machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. The projects
focus on practical implementation, experimentation, and real-world use
cases rather than isolated theory.

The work demonstrates applied ML skills across vision, time-series,
natural language processing, and LLM-based systems, complementing my PhD
research and industry software engineering experience.
