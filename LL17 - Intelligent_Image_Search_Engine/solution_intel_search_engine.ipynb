Limit to 2-3 sentences. Focus on action, lighting, and mood.\n","2.  **Text Content:** If no text is visible, return `null`. If text is visible, transcribe it exactly as it appears, preserving case where possible.\n","3.  **Keywords:** Provide exactly 10-15 keywords. Mix broad concepts (e.g., \"urban,\" \"melancholy\") with specific objects (e.g., \"red umbrella,\" \"taxi\").\n","4.  **Safety:** Do not generate content that violates safety policies.
